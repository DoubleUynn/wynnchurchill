- 👋 Hi, I’m @wynnchurchill
- 👀 I’m currently interested in cybersecurity, specifically red-teaming and penetration testing. 
- 🌱 I’m currently pursuing a CS Degree from Sattler College. Currently, it's my Junior year, and I'm taking parallel programming, digital ethics, and programming languages classes.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on web development or cybersecurity projects. If you're interested in ethical hacking and are willing to teach, I'm happy to learn.
